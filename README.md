## CarHub

This project allows you to explore different vehicles within an API from RapidAPI. This was built using React, Next JS 13, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and HeadlessUI. Hosted on vercel: https://car-hub-theta.vercel.app/?limit=30.

## Note: The vehicle images will not change as I opted out of using a paid API to add in this functionality. Sign in was also not implemented.
